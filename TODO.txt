Generic
- Redesign UI (work in progress)
- Restructure and refactor C++ code
- Refactor QML to use more states and transitions and less property bindings
- Migrate to QBS (instead of QMake)
- Use more C++11 features and idioms (whenever possible)
- Dump Visual C++ as compatible compiler and rely on GCC/MinGW/Clang instead

Specific
- Redesign login page (which I've completely neglected so far)
- Redesign "Now playing" page (possibly rename to "Playback")
- Figure out how to deal with artist/album browsing in terms of paging
- Implement UI for artist/album browsing once ^ is figured out
- Reimplement key navigation with remote control support
