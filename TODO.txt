- Redesign UI
- Reimplement key navigation with remote control support
- The code is extremely bloated and convoluted as a result of using
PIMPL and a factory to create objects. When time, perhaps reimplement all objects using sp_session_userdata() to retrieve session instead.
- All spotify objects are somewhat similar in that they (atleast in Sonata) have very similar copy constructors, assignment operators and isValid(), isLoaded() methods. Perhaps metaprogramming can be used to create a common base class despite the differences in libspotify functions being used?
